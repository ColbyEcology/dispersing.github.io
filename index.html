	Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. Pardon the dust around here (11 October--??), as I have been reworking this site.  Its purpose of this is to showcase my academic research interests and provide information for current and future collaborators.  I have organized pages with:
      <ul style=list-style-type:none>
        <li><a href="/Research">a brief description of my research and research interests,</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Teaching">links to courses I have taught and / or organized,</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Publications">publications, with links to the papers, reprints, code, and data,</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Blog">a news/blog feed,</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Photos">some photographic experiences in my work as an ecologist (not yet up!),</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Quotes">some fun quotes I've collected over the years, and</a></li>
        <li><a href="/Contact">my contact information.</a></li>
      </ul>
	Thanks again, and feel free to contact my with any questions.
