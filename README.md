This is my academic website.

I've designed it using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).  The creator of [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), **Michael Rose**, deserves huge credit for creating such a nice theme.  I've copied over his credits and license below:
