Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. Pardon the dust around here, as I have been reworking this site since October 11, 2016 (e.g., changing html to markdown).  I should be done in a week or so.  Its purpose of this is to showcase my academic research interests and provide information for current and future collaborators.  I have organized pages with

* [a brief description of my research and research interests,](/Research)
* [links to courses I have taught and / or organized,](/Teaching)
* [publications, with links to the papers, reprints, code, and data,](/Publications)
* [a blog/news feed,](/Blog)
* [some photography from my experiences as an ecologist,](/Photos)
* [some fun scientific quotes I've collected over the years, and](/Quotes)
* [more detailed contact information](/Contact)

Thanks again, and feel free to contact me with any questions.
