title: Preprint available on intraspecific density dependence with mutualism paper
---

Today we posted our paper, *Population dynamics of mutualism and intraspecific density dependence: how &theta;-logistic-like density dependence affects mutualistic positive feedback*, on bioRxiv: [link](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/13/108175).  [Karen Abbott](www.case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/), Sam Catella, and I wrote this theoretical paper that studied how nonlinear intraspecific density dependence affects the Lotka-Volterra model of mutualism.  In sum, we found that relaxing the logistic base of the Lotka-Volterra model allows for a more realistic model of mutualism by, in many cases, preventing the positive feedback that has haunted the Lotka-Volterra model since its inception.
