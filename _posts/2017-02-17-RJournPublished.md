title: QPot paper in The R Journal is in print
---
Today our paper on the quasi-potential R package was published in The R Journal's 8<sup>th</sup> volume, 2<sup>nd</sup> issue of 2016, pages 19 to 38!  It can be found on The R Journal's website, here: [link](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016-2/).  This was a highly collaborative project.  Our team was composed of a mathematician from University of Maryland, Baltimore, [Maria Cameron](http://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc), theoretical ecologists [Ben Nolting](http://www.bennolting.org) and [Karen Abbott](http://case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/Home.html), and two ecologists straddling the theory-empirical boundary, [Chris Stieha](http://www.stieha.com/) and me, the latter four from Case Western Reserve University.  Our paper built upon [Ben and Karen's paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1047.1/abstract) on using the quasi-potential to assess stability in two-dimensional stochastic systems by creating a package in R that would make it accessible to ecologists (Maria Cameron wrote the C code).  This paper is essentially a methods paper on how to use the package, with several examples to better familiarize users with how the quasi-potential actually works.  I am happy that it is finally printed!
