excerpt: "I study the ecology of species interactions, with a focus on both  positive species interactions and species interactions across space and time . . ."

My research can largely be broken into three areas, which I describe in some detail below.  First, my main focus is on the population and community ecology of [mutualistic interaction](#mutualism)&mdash;interactions where two or more species have enhanced survival or reproduction in each others' presence. It turns our that these interactions are incredibly important and but are still not well-integrated in conceptual or theoretical frameworks in  ecology.  


## Mutualism&#58; positive species interactions shape communities <a name="mutualism"></a>

As a simple thought experiment, consider iterating the effect of mutual benefit between two populations: they would feed off each other's growth and grow without any bounds.  And obviously, we don't see infinitely-large populations in nature.  My main question in studying this common type of population interaction is therefore: how is the growth of mutualist populations bounded? I am currently addressing this question through development of mathematical models in the lab of [Karen Abbott](http://www.case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/CWRU/Home.html) at Case Western Reserve University as a postdoctoral research associate.  In our work, we have found a way to re-envision different types (e.g., service, food, defense) of mutualistic interactions, developed a theory within this new framework, and generated a set of critical experiments that will allow me to test our predictions and assumptions in the future.
