As a simple thought experiment, consider iterating the effect of mutual benefit between two populations: they would feed off each other's growth and grow without any bounds.  And obviously, we don't see infinitely-large populations in nature.  My main question in studying this common type of population interaction is therefore: how is the growth of mutualist populations bounded? I am currently addressing this question through development of mathematical models in the lab of [Karen Abbott](http://www.case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/CWRU/Home.html) at Case Western Reserve University as a postdoctoral research associate.  In our work, we have found a way to re-envision different types (e.g., service, food, defense) of mutualistic interactions, developed a theory within this new framework, and generated a set of critical experiments that will allow me to test our predictions and assumptions in the future.
