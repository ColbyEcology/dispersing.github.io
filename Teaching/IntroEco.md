This site is under development to be used for *Introduction to Ecology* at Colby College for the fall semester of 2017.  The sidebar breaks the course into relevant material for both the Lecture and Laboratory portions of the course.  
There are two lectures and six labs, listed below.  The information for the Lecture and Laboratory portions is for the sections that I teach, Lecture B and Lab C2.
