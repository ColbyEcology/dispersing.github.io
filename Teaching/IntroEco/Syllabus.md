## Homepage and syllabus for *Introduction to Ecology, BI271, Lecture B* <a id="Description"></a>
BI271 B, 4 Credit hours, Fall semester 2017

Ecology is the study of the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences.  Studying these patterns provides us with the scientific foundation for understanding natural processes and environmental problems. This course will examine ecological interactions at a wide range of scales from the molecular level, through individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems, and ultimately to the biosphere. We will study how these interactions produce the patterns and processes we observe around the world. In the field-based laboratory we will learn to generate testable ecological hypotheses, develop experimental designs to test our hypotheses, and use statistical inference to quantiatively assess the outcome of our experiments, while gaining first-hand familiarity with local ecological communities.

Ecology is broadly defined as the study the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Scales of ecological inquiry begin at the molecular level and span through individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, landscapes, and ultimately through the biosphere.  A 200-level ecology course will  may emphasize the importance of ecological principles for guiding conservation of biodiversity and environmental quality, and draw on empirical examples from temperate, tropical, and polar biomes, including human-dominated ecosystems.

##### Titles and names
Students are often curious about how to address their professors.  I am comfortable with Dr. Moore, Professor Moore, or Chris.  What's most important to me is that we create a culture of mutual respect in the classroom.  As a sign of respect to you I will, by default, address you as Ms. and Mr. followed by your last name.  Should you have preferred way of being addressed (first name, nickname, etc.), please communicate that to me.

#### Meeting dates, times, and location <a id="Meeting"></a>

### Learning Goals for Ecology <a id="Goals"></a>
A. Learn the vocabulary and conceptual framework for the science of ecology.  
B. Mature in ability to assess scientific literature, with a special emphasis on data interpretation.  
C. Apply concepts and principles to topical ecological issues having implications for policy or management.  
D. Gain direct experience with generating hypotheses, developing experimental designs and applying statistical analyses to ecological data.  
E. Gain first-hand familiarity with local ecological communities.

### Grading  <a id="Grading"></a>

#### Lecture, 0.70 of the course grade

Item                | Proportion of course | Proportion of lecture (rounded) |
:-------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------------------|
Problem sets (3)    | 0.09 (0.03 each)     | 0.13 (0.04 each)                |

- **Problem sets** will include several quantitative and conceptual problems that are designed to help you apply and more deeply understand some of the concepts covered in the lecture material.  There will be one probem set per module, and they will be disributed in lecture and due at the beginning of lecture, two meetings later.
- **Paper critiques** are designed to help you more thoroughly understand the primary mode of scientific vetting and communication: peer-reviewed journal articles.  There will be three paper critiques of three different papers throughout the semester, with each subsequent critique designed to be more challenging by asking you to more thoroughly understand and substantively criticize the article.
- **Assessments** are a method used to gauge your understanding of the lecture material while simultaneously rewarding those who have mastered it.
