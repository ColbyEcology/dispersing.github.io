## Homepage and syllabus for *Introduction to Ecology, BI 271, Lecture B* <a id="Description"></a>
BI 271, <span style="color: red">TBA</span>  Credits, Fall 2017

Ecology is the study of the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences.  Studying these patterns provides us with the scientific foundation for understanding natural processes and environmental problems. This course will examine ecological interactions at a wide range of scales from the molecular level, through individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems, and ultimately to the biosphere. We will study how these interactions produce the patterns and processes we observe around the world. In the field-based laboratory we will learn to generate testable ecological hypotheses, develop experimental designs to test our hypotheses, and use statistical inference to quantiatively assess the outcome of our experiments, while gaining first-hand familiarity with local ecological communities.

Ecology is broadly defined as the study the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Scales of ecological inquiry begin at the molecular level and span through individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, landscapes, and ultimately through the biosphere.  A 200-level ecology course will  may emphasize the importance of ecological principles for guiding conservation of biodiversity and environmental quality, and draw on empirical examples from temperate, tropical, and polar biomes, including human-dominated ecosystems.

### Learning Goals for Ecology <a id="Goals"></a>

A. Learn the vocabulary and conceptual framework for the science of ecology.  
B. Mature in ability to assess scientific literature, with a special emphasis on data interpretation.  
C. Apply concepts and principles to topical ecological issues having implications for policy or management.  
D. Gain direct experience with generating hypotheses, developing experimental designs and applying statistical analyses to ecological data.  
E. Gain first-hand familiarity with local ecological communities.
